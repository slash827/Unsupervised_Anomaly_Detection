# Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection
This project is the final project of a course in Unsupervised Learning at Bar Ilan University.
To start please run main.py to first make sure that the dataset has been downloaded to a directory named "data".
Once the dataset is available, you can run any of the code files. each performs some sort of task.
In case there is a problem downloading the dataset, you can download it directly from kaggle in the url:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/katehighnam/beth-dataset/data?select=labelled_training_data.csv
Extract the zip file into a directory named "data" in the same directory of the project.


Description of each file - each file does some independent task:
main - the first file to run, downloads the dataset.
autoencoder.py - autoencoder implementation and training on benign samples and evaluating on both benign and malicious samples.
