I'll provide some ideas and implementations to extend the EDA for the BETH dataset. Based on the existing code and our previous discussion about user behavior analysis, here are several valuable additions:

I've created a comprehensive enhanced EDA implementation for the BETH dataset. Here are the key improvements and additions:

### 1. Data Loading and Overview
- Added file size information for each CSV
- Preserved source file information in the dataset
- Added memory usage analysis per column
- Added duplicate detection

### 2. Missing Value Analysis
- More detailed missing value statistics with percentage
- Visual representation of missing values

### 3. Enhanced Numeric Feature Analysis
- Added range and coefficient of variation to statistical summary
- Skewness detection for identifying non-normal distributions
- Distribution visualization for key numeric features
- Correlation analysis with heatmap
- Automatic detection of highly correlated feature pairs

### 4. Categorical Feature Analysis
- Value counts and distribution for categorical variables
- Visual representation of top categories

### 5. Target Variable Analysis
- Class distribution analysis with visualization
- Class imbalance calculation

### 6. User Behavior Analysis
- Analysis of actions per user
- Evil action distribution per user
- Identification of suspicious users based on evil ratio
- Distribution plots of user activity and evil ratios

### 7. Temporal Analysis (if applicable)
- Added time-based features (hour, day, day of week)
- Activity patterns by hour of day
- Visualization of evil ratios by time period

### 8. Feature Importance
- Random Forest-based feature importance
- Visual representation of top 15 features

This enhanced EDA provides a much more thorough exploration of the data, with a particular focus on user 
behavior patterns and identifying suspicious activities. 
All visualizations are automatically saved as PNG files for easier reporting.

Some implementation highlights:
- Automatic sampling for large datasets to make computations feasible
- Adaptive parameters for T-SNE based on dataset size
- Special handling for user sequence analysis when timestamps are available
- Thorough documentation of findings throughout the analysis
